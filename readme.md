How to start the creature:

The creature can be run by running search.py in terminal

What tasks I did:

- I added 8 legs to the creature with 8 sensors and 12 motors
- In addition, the dimension (length, width, height) of the 4 inner legs changes during mutation to see if the mutated version moves further than the parent version.

What I observed:

- Before evolution, the creature moves clockwise for a little while then stops. After evolving lower leg dimensions, I observed that the creatures likes to go  anticlockwise and it doesn't stop.
